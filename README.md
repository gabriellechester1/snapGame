# Snap

To play the game run `Main.java` with java 11+

The user is asked for the number of decks they would like to play with, if this is just one they will be able to then 
choose to snap on value or on suit. 
If they choose more than one deck of cards they will also get to choose if they would like to snap on when it matches 
value and suit.

The player who plays the 'snapping' card, will win the hand. 

The winner is the player who accumulates the whole deck, if the game is played and not snap conditions and both players 
run out of cards, the game is a draw.
